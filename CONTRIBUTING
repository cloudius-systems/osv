We welcome code contributions to the OSv open-source project, in the form of
patches.

The OSv project does not require copyright assignment - the copyright on your
own contribution remains yours. However, contributions are independent, so you
are considered a copyright holder of your piece of the code - not of the entire
project.

When you send a patch to the OSv project, we want you to certify that you wrote
this patch, or otherwise have the right to submit it for inclusion in OSv.
In more details, we want you to agree that:

        By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

        (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
            are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
            personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
            maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
            this project or the open source license(s) involved.

To state that you agree to these conditions for code contribution, all you need
to do is to add a line to your patch stating:

	Signed-off-by: Your Real Name <your@email.address>

You may notice that the above four conditions are identical to the "Developer's
Certificate of Origin 1.1" used in the Linux kernel's development. The
"signed-off-by" process was copied from Linux as well.
