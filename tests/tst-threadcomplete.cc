// Test std::thread's complete functionality() (and as a result, also pthread's, which
// std::thread uses internally). Threads need to be either attached or joined, and we
// will test them both. Our hope here is to create threads that are extremely short and
// will complete very rapidly, therefore racing with both detach and join. We will call
// attach and join in various orders, hoping that if there is a race, it will show up.
//
// Passing this test doesn't mean it works, but failing means it doesn't.
// Unfortunately there are no checks to be done here.  Failure will manifest in
// this crashing or hanging.
