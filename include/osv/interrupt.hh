/* this is an abstract class for interrupts, archs can derive
 * from this one to model their interrupts.
 *
 * interrupt_id is an interrupt identifier,
 * (example: for x64 gsi, for aarch64 the arm gic interrupt id),
 *
 * ack is the interrupt ack routine.
 *   The ack routine is supposed to verify and ack the interrupt status
 *   from the device and return true if an interrupt is pending for that
 *   device. This is necessary in particular for shared irqs.
 *   For irqs which do not require any ack, a convenience constructor is
 *   available which provides a default ack [] { return true; } lambda.
 *
 * Derived classes are supposed to register into the interrupt table
 * in the constructor, and deregister in the destructor.
