/**
 * Run the given executable.
 *
 * Currently, The executable is assumed to be a shared object with a \c main()
 * function as in Unix (i.e., a \c main function with C linkage, taking argc
 * and argv and returning an int).
 * This \c main function is run in the current thread.
 *
 * run() loads the given shared object into memory, and unloads it if the caller
 * does not save the returned shared pointer.
 * In particular, if the same object is run concurrently, it will only be
 * unloaded after the last of the concurrent runs has finished.
 *
 * It is worth noting how run() of a shared object differs Unix's traditional
 * exec() of an executable:
 *
 * \li run() runs the \c main function in the current thread, but other treads
 *     continue to run normally. run() returns when the \c main function
 *     returns.
 * \li When a Unix executable exits, its resources are all cleaned up. But our
 *     shared objects need to clean up after themselves. If main() completes
 *     with memory allocated, with open files, etc., then these resources will
 *     never be freed. If main() returns while threads are still running its
 *     code, or pointers to its memory are somewhere in the kernel's
 *     structures, a crash will likely soon follow.
 *     A convenient way to ensure that certain cleanups happen when the object
 *     is unloaded is to use static objects with destructors. These
 *     destructors are guaranteed to be run when the object is unloaded.
 *     To run a main() which returns without waiting for all its threads to
 *     finish, you must use elf::program::get_library() directly.
 * \li When several instances of the same object run concurrently, they share
 *     a single copy of static and global variables. Therefore main() cannot
 *     assume that when it starts, static variables have their default values.
 *     Moreover, a shared-object which is to be run concurrently on multiple
 *     threads needs to access its global variables in a thread-safe manner
 *     (e.g., using mutexes), or avoid globals, even if each main() call itself
 *     is single-threaded. Some non-reentrant library functions (such as
 *     getopt() with its \c optind global) are especially problematic in this
 *     regard.
 * \li The main() must complete with "return", not with exit().
