/**
 * In C++11, "new T()" is not guaranteed to fulfill unusual alignment
 * requirements that T might have. The problem is that there is no way to
 * tell "operator new" (which "new T()" calls to allocate memory) to use
 * a particular alignment. C++17 fixed both oversights, but we cannot use
 * C++17 yet in OSv which only assumes C++11.
 * So our workaround is a template aligned_new<T> which behaves like a
 * "new" expression, but uses the C11 aligned_alloc() instead of C++'s
 * operator new to allocate memory. We assume, and this is currently the
 * case in OSv, that operator new and malloc() do the same thing anyway
 * and it is legal to call "operator delete" on memory returned by
 * aligned_alloc().
 *
 * In the future, when C++17 becomes common, we can switch to using ordinary
 * new instead of aligned_new.

// Memory allocated in aligned_new with aligned_alloc() should be freed with

// really the same thing, gcc is sometimes able to warn about std::unique_ptr<>
// being given a pointer created by aligned_new() but the default deleter is
// "delete".  In this case, use the following alternative deleter.
// For example:
//    auto x = std::unique_ptr<T, aligned_new_deleter<T>(aligned_new<T>(...))

// an ordinary "delete" (as explained above), here, an array allocated by an
// aligned_array_new() CANNOT be deleted by a "delete[]" expression! This is
// because we do not know the internal layout of "new[]" of this compiler
// to allow a delete[] to work out of the box (delete[] needs to be able
// to figure out the number of individual objects in the array which it
// needs to destruct). So we have a separate aligned_array_delete().
